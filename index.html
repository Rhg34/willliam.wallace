    <h1>Who is William Wallace</h1>
    <p>William Wallace, born 1207 - died 23 August 1305, was one of the key figures in the rebellion against the English invasions in the First Scottish War of Independence.</p>
    
    <h1>How the Wars of Independence Started</h1>
    <p>Prince Alexander of Scotland, the son of King Alexander III of Scotland, was born in 1264 and died on January 28, 1284. He was the heir apparent to the Scottish throne but predeceased his father, which led to a succession crisis after the death of King Alexander III in 1286.</p>
    
    <p>King Alexander III of Scotland named his son Alexander, who became known as Alexander, Prince of Scotland. The young prince was his only son and the heir apparent, but he tragically died in 1284 at the age of 20, preceding his father and leaving the royal succession in crisis.</p>
    
    <p>King Alexander III of Scotland died tragically on the night of March 19, 1286, in a riding accident near Kinghorn in Fife. While traveling to join his queen, Yolande de Dreux, Alexander was separated from his companions in a stormy darkness. The king, renowned for his effective and stable reign, was thrown from his horse along the steep coastal path and was found dead at the bottom of a rocky embankment the following day. His untimely death at the age of 45 left Scotland without a direct male heir, plunging the nation into a period of uncertainty and leading to the succession crisis that ultimately precipitated the Wars of Scottish Independence.</p>
    
    <p>William Wallace started this tactic when the sheriff of Lanark took his wife's life (Marion Braidfute), so in return he sliced him into pieces. William Wallace gained his publicity by using a technique called guerrilla tactics, which meant that he went around places with a group of men and in the day they hid but in the night they dispersed the horror that they could display.</p>
